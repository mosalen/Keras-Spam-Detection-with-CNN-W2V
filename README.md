# Keras-Spam-Detection-with-CNN-W2V
A simple implement of deep learning in text classification.

# Models
This repository includes four models written in Keras: Bayes, SVM, CNN, ann LSTM. All of them could be run independently, and feel free to combine them. It works well!


# Word2Vec
I have pre-trainned a W2V model with huge Chinese corpus (dim=128, size=3.1G). Ask me if you need it. Or you could use any word embedding models instead.

# Data
I have crawled over 40,000 reviews from Taobao.com, the e-commerce leader in China. This project is built to detect review spam in that dataset. Also, ask me if you need it.

# Others
This repository is not creative but stable and useful. However, if you are interested in natural language processing and text classification, please feel free to talk to me. I have implemented a new project for review spam detection, in which I improve the BERT model, which is also generalizable to any text classification tasks. I will get it pulic later.
